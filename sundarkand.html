        The Sundar Kanda describes an inspiring and exciting account of the adventures of Lord Hanuman. It gives a detailed account of Hanuman’s physical prowess and superior intelligence.

The work describes Hanuman’s selflessness, strength, and devotion to Lord Rama. It gives an account of Lord Hanuman’s journey to Lanka.

Here, we give you a brief account of the Sundar Kanda story.

Hanuman chanted the name of Lord Rama and assumed a massive form to leap over the sea to reach Lanka. He fought and overpowered many demons (like Surasa) on the way to Lanka. However, no one could stop him from reaching Lanka through the sky route.

When Hanuman reached Lanka, he finds the whereabouts of Sita and finally found her in Ashok Vatika. Hanuman pacifies agony stricken Sita. He learns that Ravana threatened Sita. She was being tortured to marry Ravana.

Hanuman instills confidence in Sita. He gives Rama’s signet ring as a sign of good faith. He assures Sita that her beloved husband, Lord Rama, would soon arrive at Lanka to rescue her from Ravana’s captivity.

He even offers to carry Sita back to Rama. However, Sita refuses this offer saying that he would not allow anyone other than her husband to rescue her. Sita tells Hanuman that Rama himself must come to save her and avenge the insult of her abduction.

Hanuman then creates havoc in Lanka by destroying demons and buildings. He killed many of Ravana’s warriors. Finally, he allowed himself to be captured and produced before Ravana. Hanuman had a dialogue with the demon king Ravana and lectures him to release Sita.

However, Ravana gave no heed to his advice. On the contrary, Ravana was very angry with Hanuman and ordered his soldiers to set fire to Hanuman’s tail. Hanuman escaped his bonds and jumped hither and thither in Lanka, putting Lanka’s whole city ablaze. Finally, Hanuman makes a giant leap back from the island. He returned to Kishkindha to tell Lord Rama about the good news of finding Sita.
